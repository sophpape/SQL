-This project uses a database that stores data for 'chinook', a digital media store.
-Below I have used a few questions to analyze the data about the store. Tables include information about employees, artists, albums, etc.

WHERE Country != "USA";

SELECT * FROM chinook.customers 
WHERE Country = "Canada";

3. Find the invoices of customers from Brazil.
SELECT cust.FirstName, cust.LastName, inv.InvoiceId, inv.BillingCountry, inv.InvoiceDate
FROM chinook.invoices as inv 
LEFT JOIN chinook.customers as cust

WHERE inv.BillingCountry = "Brazil";

4. Show the employees who are also Sales Agents.
SELECT * FROM chinook.Employees

JOIN chinook.Customers cust ON cust.SupportRepId = emp.EmployeeId
JOIN chinook.Invoices Inv ON Inv.CustomerId = cust.CustomerId;

7. Show the invoice total, customer name, country, and sales agent name for all invoices and customers.
SELECT emp.LastName, emp.Firstname, cust.FirstName, cust.LastName, cust.Country, inv.total
FROM chinook.employees emp 
JOIN chinook.Customers cust ON cust.SupportRepId = emp.EmployeeId
JOIN chinook.Invoices Inv ON Inv.CustomerId = cust.CustomerId;

8. How many invoices were there in 2009?
SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM chinook.Invoices
WHERE InvoiceDate BETWEEN '2009-01-01' AND '2009-12-31';

9. What are the total sales for 2009?
SELECT SUM(Total)
FROM chinook.Invoices

10. Write a query that includes the purchased track name with each invoice line ID.
SELECT t.Name, i.InvoiceLineId

11. Write a query that includes the purchased track name AND artist name with each invoice line ID.
SELECT ar.name as Artist, t.Name as Track, i.InvoiceLineId
FROM chinook.Invoice_items i
LEFT JOIN chinook.tracks t 
ON i.TrackID=t.TrackID
INNER JOIN chinook.albums a
ON a.AlbumID=t.AlbumID
LEFT JOIN chinook.artists ar

12. Provide a query that shows all the tracks, and include the album name, media type, and genre.

on a.AlbumId = t.AlbumId
JOIN chinook.Media_Types m
on m.MediaTypeId = t.MediaTypeId
JOIN chinook.Genres g
on g.GenreId = t.GenreId;

13. Show the total sales made by each sales agent.

ROUND(SUM(Inv.Total), 2) as 'Total Sales' 
FROM chinook.Employees emp

JOIN chinook.Invoices Inv 
ON Inv.CustomerId = cust.CustomerId
WHERE emp.Title = 'Sales Support Agent' 
GROUP BY emp.FirstName;

14. Which sales agent made the most dollars in sales in 2009?
SELECT emp.FirstName, emp.LastName,

JOIN chinook.Invoices Inv 
ON Inv.CustomerId = cust.CustomerId
WHERE emp.Title = 'Sales Support Agent' 
AND Inv.InvoiceDate LIKE '2009%' 
GROUP BY emp.FirstName
ORDER BY (round(sum(Inv.Total), 2))  DESC LIMIT 1;
