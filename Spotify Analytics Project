This project utilizes data downloaded from Kaggle about Spotify's top 50 songs in 2021. 
I created a table for the Spotity data and used SQL to analyze it.

This is the created table:
CREATE TABLE BIT_DB.Spotifydata (
id integer PRIMARY KEY,
artist_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_id varchar NOT NULL,
popularity integer NOT NULL,
danceability decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
energy decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
key integer NOT NULL,
loudness decimal(5,3) NOT NULL,
mode integer NOT NULL,
speechiness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
acousticness decimal(6,5) NOT NULL,
instrumentalness text NOT NULL,
liveness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
valence decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
tempo decimal(6,3) NOT NULL,
duration_ms integer NOT NULL,
time_signature integer NOT NULL 
)

After inserting the Spotify Data .csv into the table I answered questions about the data.

1. Who are the top 10 artists by popularity?
SELECT track_name, artist_name, popularity
FROM BIT_DB.spotifydata
ORDER BY popularity desc
LIMIT 10

2. What is the average danceability by artist and track?
SELECT artist_name, track_name, avg(danceability)
FROM BIT_DB.spotifydata
GROUP BY artist_name, track_name
